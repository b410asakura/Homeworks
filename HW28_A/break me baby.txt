Sun is down on East side
We all turn a blind eye
You know I've got your back
But would you ever do that for me?
For me?
For me? Yeah, for me
Oh, Billy boy he's gifted
You know you can't deny it
Don't leave us empty handed
'Cause you know we don't deserve that
From you
From you
From you, from you
I want to break my baby
You know she loves to fake it
I want to break my baby
Yeah, hold her down, bring her down now
Oh now
They'll take you in
And spit you out
You're only worth how much you sell
Yes, now
You've come too far
We both agree
Just give the people what they need
Well, well, will you turn away?
Will you take my place?
Does it start to show
Now the pressure's on?
Will they call my name
When it all goes up in flames?
Or will you be by my side?
I want to break my baby
You know she loves to fake it
I want to break my baby, oh yeah
Oh, hold it down
Well, break it down now
Whoa, break down
Whoo-ooh, oh, all night long
Whoa, all night long
All night long
Baby, baby (Break my baby)
Baby, baby (Break my baby)
You know she loves to fake it
Hey, my baby
